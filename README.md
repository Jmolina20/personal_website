** "The last pineapple": The year is 7,000 and humanity has surpassed every political and social disagreement, save for one. The division that ruined friendships, families and communities around the world. Does Pineapple belong on Pizza? These divisions ran so deep that the pro-pineapple and anti-pineapple groups secluded themselves within their own dyson rectangles so as to not "mingle with the other." There was one last attempt by both leaders to reach peace via sending the last fresh pineapple in existance, but due to malicious tampering it has become rotten and smelly to the point that any contact with the pineapple will destroy the dyson rectangle it attaches to. So it has become a race to the bottom as both factions would rather sacrifice the other to save their own skin. You have 30 seconds to pick a side and send off the pineapple, who will you defend and can you save them .....from the last pineapple?
